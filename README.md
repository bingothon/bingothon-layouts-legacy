# esaw18-layouts

You need to update the included Browser Source in OBS Studio to correctly use these layouts; the one they include is still outdated. Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/kc5nra/obs-browser/releases) and get the latest ZIP (`obs-browser-1.30.-.3239.zip` at the time of writing) and extract it into your OBS Studio install directory.

For the intermission layout, if you want adverts to run when it is switched to in OBS Studio, add `#adverts` to the end of the URL.
