# bingothon-layouts

> The on-screen graphics used during Bingothon 2018 & 2019.

*This is a bundle for [NodeCG](https://nodecg.com/); if you do not understand what that is, we advise you read their website first for more information.*

This is a [NodeCG](https://nodecg.com) v1 bundle. You will need to have NodeCG v1 installed to run it. It also requires you to install the [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) and the [speedcontrol-bingothon](https://github.com/bingothon/speedcontrol-bingothon) bundle.

You need to update the included Browser Source in OBS Studio to correctly use these layouts; the one they include is still outdated. Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/kc5nra/obs-browser/releases) and get the latest ZIP (`obs-browser-1.30.-.3239.zip` at the time of writing) and extract it into your OBS Studio install directory.

For the intermission layout, if you want adverts to run when it is switched to in OBS Studio, add `(ads)` to your scene name.
